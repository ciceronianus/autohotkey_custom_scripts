# What is this?
Place for my future AutoHotkey scripts (although some will be probably in respositories dedicated to specific apps, like Roam).

# What is here?
- At this moment only COC - Custom Overengineered Clipboard

# COC - Custom Overengineered Clipboard (alpha)
## What does COC? 
Basically, it allows you to define specific custom clipboards (text only) into which you can save any text. 
None, one or many can be active at the same time and you can also send a specific text to a specific clipboard.

## How to invoke it?
By default, it is map on Control + Right Mouse Button - feel free to change it! :) 

## How to set it up? 
- `custom_clipboards_list.txt` - contains a list of clipboards - simply change it to your wishes :)
- Each clipbaord is saved in a separate txt file in the ^^clipboards^^ subfolder
- Quick input - prompts a menu to send a text string to active clipboards
- Clear/ClearAll - deletes a file/files
- DeselectAll - removes selection of clipboards
